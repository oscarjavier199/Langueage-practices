#The problem with having functions called implicitly is sometimes you want the child to behave differently.
#In this case you want to override the function in the child, effectively replacing the functionality. To do this
#just define a function with the same name in Child. Hereâ€™s an example:

class Parent(object):
    def override(self):
        print("PARENT override()")

class Child(Parent):
    def override(self):
        print("CHILD override")
        
dad = Parent()
son = Child()

dad.override
son.override
